Game Of Life
============

Code for Conway's Game of Life based on ["Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design and other lessons from watching thousands of pairs work on Conway's Game of Life"](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign) by Corey Haines.

Basically I'm reading through the book and implementing basic ideas as I go. I'm not (for now) focussing on generating a complete, working implementation, although once I get through the book I might consider going back to the drawing board and trying to build a full implementation.

This is also currently all in Ruby (as is the example code in the book), but it would be interesting to do all this in other languages like Clojure and JS and CoffeeScript as practice exercises.
